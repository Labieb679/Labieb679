# About Me

Hi there! I'm Labieb Nekeb, a computer science students based in Cardiff, Wales. With a strong background in mathematics and sciences, I thrive on turning innovative ideas into practical and programmable projects and solutions. My journey in the tech world is fueled by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, this has drawn me towards computer science as it is currently the fastest developing field and to be skilled in computer science will certainly be very beneficial in the future. I come from a north african arab background, being from Libya the culture is not as advanced and which is why I hope to become a compotent programmer and developer to then benefit my home country in any way, considering that Libya is lacking heavily in the computing and technological fields. When starting my course in computer science, i thought it would be heavily focused on learning and understanding code. I was very mistaken. There are various modules which help to understand computing concepts and sectors.

# Education

- **Degree:** currently year 1 Computer science Bcs
- **University:** University of South Wales, Treforest campus - Pontypridd.
- **Graduation Year:** 2027

- **Previous Education:** achieved qualifications in A-level: Mathematics, Biology, Product Design and Arabic. 
- considering the qualifications i had chosen and achieved, it did not dawn upon me that i would be interested in studying computer science, but towards the end of my A-level education i realised that the future of many working fields would lean towards AI and technological development. This established my intrest for computer science and software engineering.
